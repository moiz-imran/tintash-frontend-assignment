# Tintash Frontend Assignment

Hey there! 👋 Thanks for your interest in working with us! The next step for you is a frontend assigment.

# The Assignment
Develop a dashboard interface following the link specifications: [Figma Layout Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/g9SwumqkKzh0pnw3x2zI7C/Tintash-Frontend-Assignment?node-id=0%3A1&t=0OTct2MIuJWwbNR2-1)

# Expectations
- We expect you to read the chakra-ui docs, and use their components to create the interface.
- We expect simple and well written components, always using the React Hooks.
- Your components should receive props that should be typed with typescript.
- If we change the theme, your components should respect it.

# Questions

Along with the development of the dashboard, we expect you to go in-depth on at the following questions:

1. How will you organize the interface components and name them?
2. Will you use a component library to implement charts components? Which one? Explain why.
3. How could you share data and states information between the cards? Tell us about one simple and one complex way and how to decide which one to implement.
4. How would you organize your components in a scalable application architecture providing support to create components variants, and reuse them in a simple and elegant pattern?


# Development Instructions

1. Once you have opened the link you must sign up and log in so you can have access to the colors, fonts, margins and assets information.
2. Develop the interface as close as possible to the mockup.
3. Implement project theme provider, component rules, props and make it able to interact with external data.
4. [__BONUS__] Test a piece of the codebase. You can choose which part and functions to test.
5. [__BONUS__] Implement motion/animation transitions for the first card component, on the accordion transition. Surprise us by choosing for yourself which aspects to implement.
6. We recommend you follow our React stack including Typescript, [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro). But it is not a requirement.


# Delivery Instructions

- Download the code, push this as is to a private repository's main branch in your Github account. Add ```moiz-imran``` to the project.
- Implement your solution in a separate branch, open a Pull Request against the main branch and add ```moiz-imran``` as a reviewer.
- Modify this README in your branch to mention any assumptions and answers to the questions above. Also feel free to mention any diversions from the assigned tasks.
